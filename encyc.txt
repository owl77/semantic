 The ‘Atmosphere’ refers to the  blanket of air enveloping the Earth.   It consists of gases, particles and  various other materials. The main  component of the atmosphere is  nitrogen which occupies around  78%, followed by oxygen that  constitutes 21%. The rest of the 1%  is made up of carbon dioxide and  other materials that include minute  particles of water vapour, methane, carbon monoxide, hydrogen,  nitrous oxide, ozone, neon, helium, krypton nd xenon gases. In  addition to these gases, the atmosphere also consists of smoke, dust  particles, volcanic ash, meteoric dust, pollen, etc.   The atmosphere is made up of many layers. The layers closer to  the Earth’s surface are denser than the one’s away from it. The  atmosphere extends up to 500 kilometers from the earth’s surface  and the pressure, temperature and density vary according to its  height. The air pressure reduces to half as we ascend 6 kilometers  from the Earth and similarly, the temperature falls by 1 degree  Fahrenheit at the height of every 91 metres.    Argon     Oxygen     Gases in the Atmosphere        Based on its physical properties, the atmosphere has been divided  into the following layers:   1. Troposphere: Accounting for 75% of the total weight of the  atmosphere, the troposphere extends up to 17 kilometers  from the Earth’s surface. It is the most essential layer of the  atmosphere as all living beings live in this layer. Moreover, rain,  clouds, storm, etc. are all formed in this layer.   2. Stratosphere: Extending  till 48 kilometers, the  most important function  of the stratosphere is  that it absorbs the ozone  rays radiated by the sun.   These layers are extremely  dangerous for human  beings. There are neither  strong winds nor varying  temperatures in this layer.   3. Mesosphere: This layer begins from a height of 50 kilometers  from the Earth’s surface. The temperature in this layer is very  low and it is the lowest at a height of 85 kilometers.   4. Ionosphere: Starting above the Mesosphere, this layer extends  up to 500 kilometers. It consists of charged particles that reflect  radio waves towards the Earth and make radio communication  possible.   5. Exosphere: This is the outermost layer of the atmosphere, and  the density here is very low. Due to the presence of helium and  hydrogen, the chief components of this layer, the temperature  here is very high.   Actually, the atmosphere is extremely vital for our existence as it  protects us from all the harmful radiations, meteors, etc. that come  from the outer space.

The air density is the lowest and  this layer comprises just 0,001 % of the total volume  of the atmospheric gases.   In the ionosphere, sun radiations cause ionisation,  i.e., the particles are electrically charged. The  ionosphere reflects the radio waves employed in  telecommunications.   The magnetosphere is located above the ionosphere,  at the external limit of the Earth’s magnetic field. It  behaves like a giant magnet, retaining high energy  particles and thus protecting the Earth. This layer  has the lowest density.        AN APPLE A DAY KEEPS THE  DOCTOR AWAY    There is an age-old saying, “An apple  a day, keeps the doctor away.” But is it  actually true? Does an apple actually have  the properties to keep all diseases at bay?  The answer is NO.   This saying was just made as a polite way  of making people realise that eating apples  is a good habit as it prevents constipation  and other related ailments. The juice of  a raw apple is believed to help in the  fermentation of undigested food.      Though people of modern  times find it arguable, it is  unquestionable that apple is  good for health. An apple has  high nutritive value due to which  eating it is suggested as a habit  one should develop, particularly     the children and youngsters. Even older people can be benefitted  by eating this fruit daily.   Some people have modified the saying as, “An apple a day, keeps  the dentist away.” This is so because it is believed that biting an apple  helps remove the food particles lodged between the teeth effectively.  It is said that eating an apple between meals and brushing our teeth  in the morning and before retiring for the night is the best way to  maintain oral health.   Due to its nutritional values, an apple  is also believed to prevent diseases,  such as scurvy, night blindness, etc.   Since apples are rich in Vitamin A, C,  cellulose and carbohydrates, they help  in purifying blood, healing wounds,  provide protection from cold, etc.   They also assist in building strong bones, teeth and gums.   Eaten raw for taste and beneficial nutrients, an apple contains 80%  water, while the remaining matter contains ascorbic acid (Vitamin  C), sugar, other acids and rough indigestible matter.   Apart from being eaten raw, apples are also used to prepare sweet  dishes, such as apple pie, etc. Cider is also brewed from fermented  apples.   Apples are a member of the Rosaceae family. They are usually  red, yellow, or green in colour in their ripened state. They grow in  temperate zones, in relatively cold weather.   By the end of 300 A.D., 37 varieties  of apples were named by a Roman  writer. However, in today’s date,  various varieties of apples are  available, which differ in sweetness  and flavour.         (QuicH tJhcks    A fresh apple is an ideal, healthy snack for you  because it’s easy to carry, quite filling, juicy and  refreshing. Some varieties provide you with a  good source of Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant  and helps to improve and maintain your immune  system.   Apples also carry relatively low calories and  contain high level of fructose. This natural sugar,  although sweeter than sucrose (main component  of cane sugar), gets metabolised slowly in the  body, thereby helping us to control our blood sugar  levels.   In herbal medicine, you’ll see people using ripe,  uncooked apples to treat constipation, while  you can eat it stewed for treating diarrhoea and  gastroenteritis. You can also use apples in poultices  for skin inflammations.        Chapter - 3    WHY DO WE GET PINS  AND NEEDLES?    The tingling sensation that we get in our hands, feet, arms, or legs  after they haven’t been moved for some time is because the blood  begins to circulate again in those parts of our body. In scientific  terms, this sensation is called Paresthesia; however, it is generally  referred to as pins and needles.   For example, after sitting for a long  time with our legs crossed, we feel  numbness when we try to stand  up. We often refer to it as the legs  ‘falling asleep’. This happens due to  the change when the blood begins  to circulate in our legs again.   Have you ever wondered why we get this feeling? Let us try to  understand this phenomenon through an easy example. It is a fact  that blood circulates freely in our body, through blood vessels, such  as arteries and veins just like water flows freely through a stretched  water hose. Now imagine the hose is bent. What would happen?  Obviously, the water would trickle through slowly.       Something similar happens in the  case of the transportation of blood in  our body. It has two main functions:   (a) To supply food and oxygen to  different parts of the body, and (b)   To collect all the poisonous wastes.   This flow is restricted if we block the  path of our body parts for a long  time. Due to this, the poisonous  wastes get collected and this blocks the nerve cells from carrying  any kind of messages from the affected body part to the brain. This  leads to a feeling of numbness.    Paresthesia in Hands     When the body part is stretched after that, there is a sudden rush  of blood into the body part. Imagine this with the help of the water  hose example again. After bending the water hose, if it is stretched  again, it is obvious that water would be allowed to flow freely again,  causing a sudden rush in the water hose.     This situation can be of two types, transient  or chronic. Transient paresthesia is basically  the numbness that we experience commonly.  It is caused because of excessive pressure  being applied on a nerve which leads to  stopping its function temporarily. However,  chronic paresthesia indicates a problem with  Exercise to Prevent Paresthesia the functioning of the neurons, which may   require special medical attention.    Similarly, when the transportation system  of our body is released of the blockage, the  blood begins to circulate freely again. It is this  resumption of blood circulation that causes  the tingling sensation or pins and needles.      Quictl tJacU    Paresthesia sensations can be described in many  different ways, including tingling, numbness, pins  and needles, itching and burning. Paresthetic  sensations may be accompanied by pain and other  symptoms depending on the part of the body that is  affected. Any associated symptoms can help your  doctor make a diagnosis.   Paresthesia usually arises from nerve compression  (pressure or entrapment) or damage. Paresthesia  can be a symptom of a wide variety of diseases, or  disorders or due to injuries to the nerves.   Temporary paresthesia can be due to any activity  that causes prolonged pressure on a nerve or  nerves, such as sitting cross legged or bicycling  a long distance. Paresthesia can also occur with  moderate to severe orthopedic conditions, as well  as disorders and diseases that damage the nervous  system.   Because paresthesia can be due to a nervous system  disease or nerve damage, failure to seek treatment  can result in complications and permanent damage.  The general symptoms are: Chronic pain, Inability  to breathe on your own, Paralysis, Permanent loss  of sensation, etc.          THE CHANGE OF SEASONS    The Earth rotates on its own axis and also revolves around the Sun.  Day and night are caused due to the Earth’s rotation around its axis  that makes a vertical angle of 23.5 degrees. It is indeed because of  this axis that as the Earth revolves around the Sun, its rays hit the  Earth’s surface at different angles and at different times of the year  at one place.     Formation of Different Seasons      Because of the variations in the angles, the solar heat gets distributed  differently throughout the year at the same place. This uneven  distribution of the solar heat causes the change in seasons.    Around June, the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun and  this causes summer in Europe, Asia and North America. Similarly,  six months later, when the southern hemisphere is tilted towards  the Sun, it experiences summer while the northern hemisphere  experiences winter.     Arctic Circle (66.5° N)-  Tropic Of Cancer (23.5® N) -  Equator -   Tropic of Capricorn (23.5® $) -    Vernal  Equinox  March 21-22  Incoming solar  energy equal in  both hemispheres    Summer \  Solstice  June 21-22  Incoming solar  energy greatest  in Northern  Hemisphere    Autumnal in $   Equinox Hen   September 22-23  Incoming solar energy  equal in both hemispheres    Winter   Solstice   December 21-22  Incoming solar  energy greatest  in Southern  Hemisphere    Summer Solstice, Winter Solstice and Equinoxes    March 21 and  September 23 are  two special dates  as on these two  days, the Sun is  exactly over the  Equator causing  the duration of  the day and night  same (12 hours) at  every place on the  Earth. These dates  are also called  as Equinoxes.  Between March    21 and June 21, the Sun advances  towards the Tropic of Cancer, resulting  in summer season in the northern  hemisphere. This means longer days  and shorter nights. It is during this  time that the southern hemisphere  experiences winters.   Between June 21 and December 22,  the Sun moves towards the Tropic of     Globe showing the Tropic of Cancer         Capricorn, causing summers in the  southern hemisphere and winters in  the northern hemisphere. It is at this  time that the northern hemisphere  experiences shorter days and longer  nights. After December 22, the Sun  once again starts moving towards  the north and reaches the equator  on March 21. During this period, Globe Showing the Tropic of Capricorn   the days in the northern hemisphere  once again start getting longer than the nights.   During the months of March and September, due to the Sun being  overhead on the Equator, the hemispheres either experience autumn  or spring.   It is thus the rotation of the Earth around its own inclined axis and its  revolution around the Sun that causes the change in seasons from  summer to winter in different hemispheres and also the transition  from day to night.     ♦<- The seasons result from the Earth’s axis being  tilted to its orbital plane. Basically, the Earth’s axis  deviates by an angle of approximately 23.5 degrees.  Thus, at any given time during summer or winter,  one part of the planet is more directly exposed to  the rays of the Sun. This exposure alternates as  the Earth revolves in its orbit. Therefore, at any  given time, regardless of season, the northern and  southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons.  This is known as the Axial Tilt.   ♦<- The effect of axial tilt is observable as the change  in day length and altitude of the Sun at noon (the    *         culmination of the Sun) during a year.   A season is a subdivision of the year, marked by  changes in weather, ecology, and hours of daylight.  Seasons result from the yearly revolution of the  Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth’s  axis relative to the plane of revolution.   ♦<- In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are  marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that  reaches the Earth’s surface, variations of which  may cause animals to go into hibernation or to  migrate, and plants to be dormant.   During May, June and July, the northern hemisphere  is exposed to more direct sunlight because the  hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the  southern hemisphere in November, December and  January. It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the  Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer  months which increases the solar flux. However,  due to seasonal lag, June, July and August are the  hottest months in the northern hemisphere and  December, January and February are the hottest  months in the southern hemisphere.      WHY DO PLANTS AND  ANIMALS BECOME EXTINCT?     At the time Charles Darwin proposed his theory  of, ‘Survival of the Fittest’, it entered into many  controversies and received a lot of criticism.  However, in due course of time, it started  receiving wider acceptance as it was found that  certain species were found to be either extinct or  were facing extinction due to reasons explained  by Darwin in his theory.    Charles Darwin   Since the time  of evolution  of animals  and plants,  many species  have become  entirely extinct.  On the other                 hand, certain species are facing the problem  of becoming extinct. The conservation of these  species has drawn alarming attention all over  the world. Such species are called, the the  ‘endangered species’.      The causes that have led to certain species  becoming endangered are both natural and  man-made. One of the primary reasons for  this predicament is the ever-increasing human  population. In order to fulfill their needs, Deforestation   human beings encroach upon more and more forest land, leading  to scarcity of land for wildlife to survive.   To fulfill human needs, heaths and forests have  been destructed to make farming space, large-  scale wood is deforested and more and more  industries are being set up. Due to these reasons,  Migration of Birds among many others, wildlife suffers a lot.       Another reason for the extinction is hunting and poaching. Man has  hunted various species to extinction, the examples of which are the  auk and dodo. Pollution is another factor that leads to this unpleasant  phenomenon. Every year millions of birds die  painful deaths because of withering feathers as  they get covered by sticky black oil from oil spills.   Some natural factors, such as unsuitable weather  conditions, lack of food, natural calamities, etc.  also contribute to the extinction of plants and  animals.    Plants that need special measures  of protection include helleborine,  cheddar pink, monkey orchid, tufted  saxifrage, alpine catchfly, and alpine              gentian. On the other hand, animals facing extinction are elephants,  tigers, lions, ocelot, humpbacks, whale, panda, leopard, rhinoceros,  puma, polar bear, the giant sable antelope, etc.   The preservation of these species has drawn attention both at  national and international levels. Effective measures are being taken  to preserve wildlife, such as, creation of sanctuaries, implementation  of stringent laws against poaching, etc.     I'- Plants can become endangered as many of the  same ways animals become endangered. Although  conservation attempts can be made to save the  endangered plant species, help often comes too  late.   I'- Many factors can cause a plant to become   endangered. Many of the same things that endanger  animals, endanger plants too. The main cause of a  plant species to become endangered is the loss of  its natural habitat. A large reason this occurs is  because of the expansion of mankind. As the human  population grows, the more land mankind needs to  comfortably survive. Unfortunately, as this improves  the lives of humans, it threatens the survival of many  plant species.   I'- Loss of natural plants habitats is also caused by an  increase in wild fires. Over the years wild fires have  began to intensify. Many believe this is caused by  global warming. As the temperatures rise the more  wild fires appear. This causes many plant species  to loose their natural habitat.                 Other forces of nature can also threaten plant  species. For example: Severe droughts can cause  large numbers of plant species to die and possibly  become extinct.   Loss of a plant habitat also occurs due to the  agricultural industry. As the need for more  agriculture increases, the need for more land also  increases. Land is often cleared to make pastures  or crops. This causes plants to loose their habitat.  Grazing animals can threaten many plant species  as well.   Plants can also become endangered by the intent  of mankind. Many rare plants are often collected by  mankind for their rare beauty. These valuable plants  can often be found in florist shops and nurseries.   When there are no more animals of a particular  species left alive, that species is said to be extinct.            Chapter - 6     THE VISION OF OWLS     An owl can rarely be seen during the day time.   This is because while most birds are diurnal  (active in the daytime), owls are nocturnal  creatures (active at night) that ‘come to life’  in the night. The physical features of an owl  include a large head, big eyes, sharp claws,  short neck and broad wings.   Around 130 species of owls are known to  us today. Some countries regard owls as  auspicious creatures, while others consider  them a symbol of wealth and wisdom.   The peculiar thing about owls is the fact  that while they see clearer at night, they  have an extraordinary sense of hearing  during the day. It is a matter of great  curiosity to all as to how owls can see  clearer at night than in the day.   A Human Eye   Before we get to that, it is important to know how human beings see  things. The light scattered by an object is focussed at our retina by  the lenses inside the eyes. An inverted image is formed here which    An Owl     1.26            Foveo (point of  central focus)    the optic nerves  carry to the brain.   The brain then  inverts the image  and we are hence  able to see things.   The eyes of an  owl are large and  forward-pointed.   There are four  main reasons due  to which owls are  nocturnal.   Firstly, in the case  of an owl, the  distance between the retina and lens of the eye is more than that in  human beings. This forms bigger images on the retina of the owl.   Secondly, an owl’s retina has 10,000 rods and cones per square  millimetre compared to the 2,000 in humans. This enables an owl  to see five times more than us!   The third reason is a special red-coloured protein, present in an  owl’s eyes, which makes its vision extremely sensitive to light. Thus,  an owl is able to see things clearly, which others may find hazy.   The fourth and final reason for the nocturnal nature of an owl is the  fact that the pupil of the eye of an owl can dilate more, resulting in  detecting the smallest amount of light.   Because of these four factors, an owl is more comfortable watching  things in the night. Due to these properties of its eyes, in daylight,  objects appear extremely bright.   Another surprising thing about an owl is that it can rotate its head at  an angle of 180 degrees, which is till the back of his head!    Iris    Macula     Ciliary muscle  (controls the lens)    Retina   (rods and cones)    An Owl s Eye             Quicfa ffhcts   • There are around 200 different owl species.   Owls are active at night (nocturnal).   A group of owls is called a parliament.   Most owls hunt insects, small mammals and other  birds.   Some owl species hunt fish.   Owls have powerful talons (claws) which help them  catch and kill prey.   Owls have large eyes and a flat face.   Owls can turn their heads as much as 270 degrees.   Owls are farsighted, meaning they can’t see things  close to their eyes clearly.   Owls are very quiet in flight compared to other  birds of prey.   The colour of owl’s feathers helps them blend into  their environment (camouflage), which also helps  them to catch their prey.   Barn owls can be recognised by their heart shaped  face.            THE MAP OF  MIGRATORY BIRDS    Every year, in the months of spring, millions  of birds migrate from colder to temperate  regions of the world in order to breed.   Basically, they migrate to different places  to have abundance of food for them to  rear their chicks.   Birds need to adjust their metabolic systems  to meet the needs of the migration process.   Energy storage through fat accumulation  and sleep control in nocturnal migrants require special physiological  adaptations. Moreover, the feathers of a bird also suffer from wear  and tear and need to be moulted. Apart from this, migration also  requires changes in the behavioural patterns, such as flying in flocks  to reduce the energy used or risk of predation during migration.   The northern parts of North America, Europe, and Asia receive the  maximum number of migrations. The southern hemisphere also gets  migratory birds, like the double banded dotted flies from Australia  to New Zealand to breed. Wild Geese fly north in the northern  hemisphere during spring and in autumn, they fly south to breed,     Migratory Birds         while the American Gold Plover flies about 3325 kilometers non¬  stop from Alaska to Hawaii.    One may often wonder how exactly a bird is  able to find its way from its home region to the  migratory place and back. Well, the answer to  this query is the proof of a bird’s intelligence.     The main cause behind migration is the change  day due to changing seasons which ultimately  change the birds’ hormonal balance.    in the length of the    Like in any other structure where the young ones learn and follow from  the old and experienced, even birds follow this principle of migration.    Young birds that are migrating for the first time fly with the older  ones who have taken the trip before and guide them through the  migration route.    While flying, birds make note of landmarks, such as lakes, mountains,  coastlines, etc., to remember their route of  migration. Some birds are even intelligent enough  to use the sun and stars to navigate to and fro  from the migrating region.   Birds are not the only species that migrate. Many  other animals such as mammals, flying insects,  fish, locusts, eels, etc., also migrate in order to  survive bad weather, breeding problems, etc.     Eels        The word, 'migration’ comes from the Latin word,  migratus that means 'to change’ and refers to how birds  change their geographic locations seasonally.   Migration peaks in spring and fall, but in reality, there  are birds migrating 365 days a year. The actual dates of  when birds migrate depends on many factors, including  bird species, migration distance, travel speed, route,  climate and more.   Before migrating, many birds enter a state of  hyperphagia, where hormone levels compel them to  drastically increase their body weight to store fat to use  as energy while travelling. Some bird species may as  much as double their body weight in the weeks leading  up to migration.   Birds may fly from 15-600 miles or more per day during  migration, depending on when they are migrating, how  far they have to go and the conditions they face along the  route, including the availability of suitable stopovers.   Hawks, swifts, swallows and waterfowl migrate primarily  during the day, while many songbirds migrate at night, in  parts to avoid the attention of migrating predators, such  as the raptors. The cooler, calmer air at night also makes  migration more efficient for many species, while those  that migrate during the day most often take advantage of  the solar-heated thermal currents for easy soaring.   Migrating birds use the stars for navigation, as well as  the sun, wind patterns and landforms, all of which help  guide them to the same locations, each year. The earth’s  magnetic field also plays a part in how birds migrate.          THE COLOUR OF FIREWORKS     Fireworks, often known as fire crackers, are used to celebrate various  occasions of happiness, such as weddings, festivals, etc. Once  lighted, they explode and burst into a variety of colours, because  of which they remain a special attraction amongst children. Over  300 varieties of fireworks are available in today’s markets and it  is approximated that a sum of Rupees 5,000 crore is spent on the  purchase of crackers, each year.     The Colour of Fireworks    People enjoy bursting crackers and  looking at the colourful explosions.  However, have you ever wondered  where the colours in the fireworks  come from? Similar to the answers  of many general questions that we  ponder over, the answer to this one  also lies in the world of science.    Fireworks are made from a mixture of potassium nitrate, sulphur,  coal, and certain other metal salts. In addition to these, chemicals  like strontium, barium, magnesium and sodium are used that add  colour to the fireworks. These are combined with potassium chlorate.    The green colour in the fireworks is due to the presence of barium  salts, while the production of light blue colour is because of             EUROPE    A TLA    AFRICA   r qce a .v i.    AUSTRALIA    strontium sulphate. The yellow  colour is produced by strontium  carbonate, whereas strontium  nitrate gives red colour. Apart  from these, salts of sodium  impart shades of yellow, while Fireworks duringmwau   those of copper are responsible for the production of yellow hues.  The silvery rain from the fireworks comes from the presence of  aluminium powder.   At the time of explosion, the salts present in the fireworks burn to  produce various colours, creating a beautiful and colourful view.   Fireworks were first manufactured in China, thousands of years ago.  The trend was shortly followed by various regions of Europe, Arabia,  and Greece. In today’s date, the largest firework manufacturer of the  world is a small town named Sivaski, located in the south of India.   However, we must realise that the bursting of crackers causes harm  to the environment. Fireworks cause great amount of pollution  which often mixes up with fog in the winter season and creates  smog, which is harmful for plants. Moreover, a large number of trees  are destroyed, while the production of crackers. Hence, we should  burn fireworks as less as possible.    jn* \ORTH    PACIFIC  QCE A S    Tropir m iluitccr ^   PACIFIC    SOUTH   rropir of k*m xMi RICA    'fw   / r    QCE AX    -M i    .33                                  • Creating firework colours is a complex endeavour,  requiring considerable art and application of physical  science. Excluding propellants or special effects,  the points of light ejected from fireworks, termed  ‘stars’, generally require an oxygen-producer, fuel,  binder (to keep everything where it needs to be), and  colour producer. There are two main mechanisms of  colour production in fireworks, incandescence and  luminescence.   I'- Incandescence is light produced from heat. Heat  causes a substance to become hot and glow,  initially emitting infrared, then red, orange, yellow,  and white light as it becomes increasingly hotter.  When the temperature of a firework is controlled,  the glow of components, such as charcoal, can be  manipulated to be the desired colour (temperature)  at the proper time. Metals, such as aluminum,  magnesium and titanium, burn very brightly and  are useful for increasing the temperature of the  fireworks.   I'- Luminescence is light produced using energy sources  other than heat. To produce luminescence, energy  is absorbed by an electron of an atom or molecule,  causing it to become excited, but unstable. When  the electron returns to a lower energy state the  energy is released in the form of a photon (light).  The energy of the photon determines its wavelength  or colour.   I'- Sometimes the salts needed to produce the desired          colour are unstable. Barium chloride (green) is  unstable at room temperatures, so barium must  be combined with a more stable compound (e.g.,  chlorinated rubber).   Copper chloride (blue), which is present in  fireworks, on the other hand, is unstable at high  temperatures, so the firework cannot get too hot,  yet must be bright enough to be seen.          Chapter - 9    THE FORMATION OF A  RAINBOW    Rainbows are a beautiful play of colours by nature. Appearing  after rains, rainbows spread a breeze of cheer and happiness into  the hearts of its viewers. A rainbow appears when the sun shines  through the rain.     Though sunlight appears  white, it consists of seven  different shades, namely,  violet, indigo, blue, green,  yellow, orange, and red,  abbreviated as VIBGYOR.   When sunlight splits into  seven colours, the process  is called dispersion, while  the strip of the seven  colours is referred to as a  spectrum.   A rainbow usually appears after rain when tiny drops of water fill the  atmosphere. When sunrays fall on these spherical water droplets,  they act like prisms. This results in the rays getting refracted and split  up into the VIBGYOR colours as they pass through the raindrops.   Since each ray of light gets refracted in a different angle from  the prism, they separate into seven different colours, forming a  Rainbow. It also thus proves that white light is made up of seven  colours.   The shape of a rainbow is that of a semi-circular arc. This is because  the sun is circular. A rainbow is called complete when it has both  a primary and a secondary arc. The primary arc has violet on the  inner side, followed by indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red.  In the secondary arc, the order of the colours is reversed. Red colour  is on the inner side, while violet is on the outermost.   In a complete rainbow, the location of the secondary arc is above  the primary arc. This kind of a rainbow is formed when the sun’s  rays are reflected and refracted after the first reflection and refraction  within the same raindrop.   A rainbow always appears in the opposite direction from the sun. A     The Spectrum of Light            necessary requirement for the formation of a rainbow is that the sun  should shine just after the rain. It is also extremely important for our  eyes that the sun and the rainbow lie in the same plane.   Most often, rainbows are formed and seen in the early mornings or  late evenings after a heavy shower. A beautiful and vibrant sight,  rainbows are a delight to the eyes.    Quictl &<xckb   • A rainbow can be defined as a band of colours  (from red on the inside to violet on the outside)  assembled as an arc that is formed by reflection  and refraction (or bending) of the sun’s rays inside  raindrops. They appear when it is raining in one  part of the sky and sunny in another.   I'- Most people think the only colours of a rainbow are  red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet,  popularly abbreviated as VIBGYOR but a rainbow  is actually made up of an entire continuum of  colours—even colours the eye can’t see!   I'- We are able to see the colours of a rainbow because  the light of different colours is refracted when it  travels from one medium, such as air, into another-  in this case, the water of the raindrops. When all the  colours that make up sunlight are combined, they  look white, but once they are refracted, the colours  break up into the ones we see in a rainbow.         WHAT IS MILK MADE UP OF?    One often wonders why mothers  keep asking their children to  have milk every day. While some  children love milk, there is an  adequate percentage that wonders  what exactly the glass of milk  contains that prevents it from  being substituted by their favourite  aerated drink. Well, given below  are the many reasons for the same.   Milk is a highly nutritious, i.e., the white liquid produced by mammals  to feed their young ones. Usually milk obtained from cows and   buffaloes is used by human  beings. However, in many  other parts of the world, milk  is obtained from other animals  as well. For example, people  in northern Europe consume  reindeers’ milk and those in the  Middle East countries consume  goats’ milk.      A Man Milking a Goat            Milk is often known as the “complete food”. This is so because it  has all the vital nutrients to ensure our good health. Cow’s milk  constitutes 87.2% water, 3.5% proteins, 3.7% fat, and 4.9% sugar  among other vitamins and minerals. Similarly, different animals  have these nutrients too, but in different proportions.   Different nutrients have different qualities. While proteins present  in the milk help us to grow and enhance our physical strength,  sugar acts as a fuel, and fats give us extra energy. Milk also contains  minerals like calcium and phosphorus which help in bone formation.  Besides that, vitamins A, B, C, D, E, K, and niacin present in milk  help reduce vitamin deficiency for healthier growth.   Man started consuming milk over 5,000 years ago and this was the  time when he discovered its various uses. Apart from its pure form,  many other products of milk, such as curd, butter, cheese, etc. can  be obtained from milk. Over time, these products have come to use  in our domestic lives immensely.   Milk gets spoiled very  soon. To prevent  its spoilage, it is  essential to cool it  to 10 degrees Celsius  within 2 hours from  milking and should be maintained at that temperature at the time of  transportation from the source to the destination.   It is advisable to boil milk once before consuming it. This is called  pasteurisation. It is done in order to control and stop the growth of  micro bacteria in the milk. However, boiling it several times in a day  kills its nutrients.   In recent times, many people have begun preferring processed  milk due to health reasons. The consumption of homogenised and  skimmed milk is ever rising because, through these processes, the  fat in the milk is reduced or completely removed.        Quictl rJ'achs   • Milk is a white liquid produced by the mammary  glands of mammals. It is the primary source of  nutrition for young mammals before they are able  to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk  contains colostrum, which carries the mother’s  antibodies to the baby and can reduce the risk of  many diseases in the baby. It also contains many  other nutrients.   It is basically an emulsion of butterfat globules  within a water-based fluid that contains dissolved  carbohydrates and protein aggregates with minerals.   As an agricultural product, milk is extracted from  mammals and used as food for humans. In the year,  2011, worldwide dairy farms produced about 730  million tonnes of milk.   India is the world’s largest producer and consumer  of milk, yet it neither exports nor imports milk. New  Zealand, the European Union’s 27 member states,  Australia, and the United States are the world’s  largest exporters of milk and milk products. China  and Russia are the world’s largest importers of  milk and milk products.     1.41      TELESCOPES    An optical instrument, called a telescope is a tube-like tool used to  see distant objects with magnified clarity.       It was invented in 1608  by Hans Lippershey,  a Dutch optician. The  following year, Galileo  made his first telescope  with a magnification of  thirty. This made him  observe the rings of   Saturn and the moons of Hans Lippershey  Jupiter.   Today, mainly three kinds of telescopes exist:   (i) Refracting telescopes   (ii) Reflecting telescopes   (iii) Radio telescopes   People also use binoculars to observe  which are basically two telescopes joine  peaks, horse races, etc.    Galileo Galilei    Refracting    A Pair of  Binoculars        A Refracting Telescope uses its  lenses to bend or refract light. It makes  use of two lenses fitted together. A  larger sized convex objective lens  and a convex eye piece is used in an  astronomical telescope. However, a  Galilean Telescope uses a convex  lens and a concave eye piece.   Modern day RefractingTelescopes   are much more advanced.    A Convex Mirror with Light Reflecting from it   This kind of a telescope is made  of a concave mirror that gathers  and focusses light rays. It also has  a mirror near the point, where  the light rays come together. It  reflects back the rays into the  eye piece.    -) -   Principal axis i   v A U,    c    \ 1     Focal J    A Concave Mirror with Light Reflecting from it     The Newtonian Telescope   uses a mirror set at an angle of  45 degrees to reflect light into  the eye piece.   A Schmidt - Cassegrain  Telescope has a convex lens.  It reflects light into a tiny hole  in the centre of the objective    Radio Telescope    mirror.                             Radio Telescopes were invented in  1930s. Usually, they contain a dish-shaped  radio wave collector. They can see through  the clouds and can be used at any time  of the day as their work is based on radio  waves rather than light.   The largest radio dish collector in the world  is of 305 metres in diameter.     Reflecting Telescope    QuicJl tracks    Dutchman Hans Lippershey invented the telescope  in 1608, but legend has it that the device was really  invented three years earlier by kids playing with  lenses in a spectacle-maker’s shop.   Telescopes gave rise to the first high-speed  telecommunication networks: spyglasses that were  used to relay semaphore signals from miles away.   Galileo was the first to turn the telescope skyward,  leading to the discovery of Jupiter’s satellites and  craters on the moon. Less cleverly, he also pointed  his telescope at the sun, which may have triggered  his later blindness.   Ireland’s “Leviathan of Parsonstown,” a 40-ton  reflecting telescope built by the Earl of Rosse in  1845, was the world’s largest for seven decades.  But wet weather kept it shut down most of the time.        • To deliver the 100-inch mirror for the Hooker  Telescope on Mount Wilson in California, nearly  200 men with ropes guided a truck along a tortuous,  eight-hour drive to the top but it was worth it. The  Hooker Telescope proved that other galaxies exist  and that the universe is expanding.   Today, using an Internet-based Telescope such as  the Seeing in the Dark scope at New Mexico Skies,  any amateur can command a robotic observatory  while lounging at home. Most professional  astronomers now work that way too, operating  telescopes remotely with computers and rarely  looking through an eyepiece.   The NASA or the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration is the agency of the United States  government that is responsible for the nation’s  civilian space program and for aeronautics and  aerospace research. Since February 2006, the  NASA’s mission statement has been to “pioneer  the future in space exploration, scientific discovery  and aeronautics research.” The NASA launched  the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990, seven years  later with a budget of over $ 2 million.     1.45       WHY ARE SOME STARS  BIGGER THAN THE OTHERS?    While gazing at the night sky, one can easily observe that some stars  appear bigger than the others. While looking at the stars through a  telescope, one can spot the differences in the brightness and colour  of the various stars.       Have you ever wondered why this is so? The features of a star are  very mysterious. They are never constant and change depending  upon many factors.   The temperature of a star determines its colour and brightness. If  the temperature of the star is high, its brightness increases. In other  words, there is a direct relationship between the temperature of a  star and its brightness.   The brightness of a star depends on the relationship between its  colour and temperature. Together, these two factors determine  if the star would shine bright or not. Stars that appear red or  yellow have the lowest surface temperature. Stars that are yellow  or green have a slightly higher temperature. These are followed  by white-coloured stars. Stars that appear blue have the highest  surface temperature.   The temperature  of the stars that  are blue in colour  can be as high as  27,750 degrees  Celsius. The Sun  is a yellow star.   Knowing this, we  can just imagine  how much hotter  a blue star can be.   The typical temp¬  erature of a yellow  star is about  6,000 degrees  Celsius. Stars that  appear red or  fainter yellow are       The Sun        comparatively cooler, with an approximate temperature of 1,650  degrees Celsius. The above mentioned facts imply that the brightness  of stars is directly related to their surface temperature.   Apart from this, another factor that determines the brightness of  a star is its distance from us. If the star is farther away, it appears  fainter, whereas a star close to our planet shines bright.   It can also happen that stars that are much brighter than others due  to their surface temperature may not shine distinctly in the night sky  because their distance from our planet is enormous.   This situation is comparable to that of street lamps. The lamps that  are closer to our vision appear brighter than the ones that are away  from us.    Quicil <Joscfo   % Stars are all made up of matter...so this question  could be addressed as; how do forming stars obtain  more matter?. The answer is simply more gravity.  Gravity is defined as the force of attraction between  two masses. So as the star attracts more matter,  its gravity increases and this process of attracting  matter speeds up.   But the only way gravity can increase is if there  is plenty of matter available. Matter isn’t spread  out uniformly across the universe and often, it’s  clustered in vast 'pockets’ of gases and particles  called ‘Nebulae’.   • These are where stars are born. If a star is forming  inside a particular large Nebula, it has more  matter available, and therefore, the stars’ gravity  can continue to grow and create a larger star than  a star in a Nebula with less matter.       % However, the above reason is certainly not the  only reason how a star size varies, but is the  easiest to explain. It’s also easier to understand  as our Sun was created inside the same Nebula  as other local stars which is why we don’t find  particularly larger stars close to the Earth; which  is probably a good thing.     1.49        WHO MEASURED  THE UNIVERSE?    One may often wonder if it is possible for the universe to be  measured. The universe consists of not only the Earth and the Solar  System, but also stars, galaxies etc. Considering these facts, it may  seem impossible to have an 3exact measurement of the universe.    The universe is beyond imagination. It is impossible for a layman  to think about estimating the measure of the universe. Over time,     The Universe        many scientists and astronomers have attempted to solve this huge  task but it continued to stay a riddle for a long time.   This scientific breakthrough was made by American astronomer,  Edwin Hubble. He was the first scientist to successfully measure  distances beyond our galaxy, the Mi//cy Way or the ‘Akash Ganga’ as  it is called in the Indian Astronomy.   Edwin Hubble came up with various theories.   One of them was the Hubble’s Law which  states that the distant galaxies are receding  from each other at greater speed than the  galaxies closer to ours.   He used the largest telescope available (2.5  metres, on Mount Wilson, California) and  tried measuring the universe. He succeeded in  measuring the distance of stars in the Andromeda Galaxy. He did  so by measuring the brightness of the stars. Through this, he could  judge how far the stars were from each other. Due to doubts about  the brightness of the stars, he obtained a result of about 8,00,000  light years. At present, it is about two million light years away.   If we go by the Hubble’s Law, the speed of the galaxies is proportional  to the distance between them. This represents the modern day picture   of Cosmology. It suggests that all galaxies were  once very close to each other and it was only  in time that they receded from each other. This  concept even supports the Big Bang Theory  which talks about similar things.   The actual measurement of the universe did  not come forth till a long time. It was only  around the time of World War II that the  renowned astronomer, Walter Buade was  able to determine the actual measurement of   Walter Baade          1.51               galactic distances. His observations proved Edwin Hubble wrong. It  came out that the universe was much larger than what Hubble had  estimated.     The top ranked scientific justification for building  the Hubble Telescope was to determine the size  and age of the Universe through observations of  Cepheid variables in distant galaxies. This scientific  goal was so important that it put constraints on the  lower limit of the size of Hubble’s primary mirror.   Cepheids are a special type of variable stars with  very stable and predictable brightness variations.  The period of these variations depends on the  physical properties of the stars, such as their mass  and true brightness. This means that astronomers,  just by looking at the variability of their light, can  find out about the Cepheids’ physical nature, which  then can be used very effectively to determine  their distances. For this reason, cosmologists call  Cepheids as 'standard candles’.   Astronomers have used the Hubble Telescopes to  observe Cepheids with extraordinary results. The  Cepheids have then been used as stepping-stones  to make distance measurements for supernovae,  which have, in turn, given a measure for the scale  of the Universe. Today, we know the age of the  Universe to a much higher precision than before.                  Chapter -14      HOW ARE DATES  DETERMINED?   Over time, man has realised that stars are not mere objects to look  at and admire. There are innumerable stars in the sky and since  times immemorial; they have helped man in various ways.   The pole star is known as a guiding star as it leads man to his  bearings. Concepts like astronomy have emerged from the study of  these tiny sparkles in the sky. Man has always been fascinated with  stars and has hence invented powerful telescopes to study them. In  time, he has been able to extract valuable information about them.   One of the many wonderful things  about stars is that one can determine  dates with their help. In order  to understand how, we have to  undertake an activity.   In order to determine the date, make  a circle of at least 8 inches diameter  on a large sheet of paper. Then,  divide the circle into 12 equal parts, in  the same way a clock face is divided.     The Pole Star           Now, write the name of each month on each division of the paper.  At the position of 12 o’ clock, write the month, March and following  the usual order of months, list them anti-clockwise.   Locate the centre of the circle and mark it as the ‘North Star’. Now,  imagine the distance between every month on the circle which is  further divided into 30 parts.   Next, take the sheet of paper out on a clear night and hold it in such  a way that March is on the top. Visualise the diagram in the night  sky with the North Star in the centre. Take note of the location of  the Bid Dipper and draw it on the diagram in the same way you  find it in the sky. After this, draw a straight line from the pointer to  the North Star. The line drawn will pass through the circle at a point  which will indicate the date of when the observation has been taken.   For example, if the line passes between June and July, it is the 15th of  June. It is important to draw a large circle, or else, it would be difficult  to find the exact date. One can only come near the actual date.   The vital part is to remember that on the diagram, if an observation  is made at midnight on a particular date, the pointers should be in  the line with that date on the star calendar. This is the way of finding  the date with the help of stars.     The Big Dipper          I'- The Gregorian Calendar is today’s internationally  accepted civil calendar and is also known as the  'Western Calendar’ or the 'Christian Calendar’. It  was named after the man who first introduced it in  February 1582 called Pope Gregory XIII.   ♦' The calendar is strictly a solar calendar based on  a 365-day common year divided into 12 months  of irregular lengths. Each month consists of either  30 or 31 days with 1 month consisting of 28 days  during the common year. A Leap Year usually  occurs after every 4 years which adds an extra day  to make the second month of February, 29 days  long rather than 28 days.   • The Gregorian Calendar reformed the Julian Calendar  because the Julian Calendar introduced an error of 1  day, every 128 years. However, a number of days had  to be dropped when the change was made.   The Gregorian Calendar was first adopted in Italy,  Poland, Portugal and Spain in 1582.   f- The rule for calculating Leap Years was changed to  include that a year is a Leap Year if:   a) The year is evenly divisible by 4.   b) If the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is  NOT a leap year, unless the year is also evenly  divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.          Chapter -15     WHY DON'T WE FEEL THE  EARTH'S MOTION?    Earlier, it was believed that the Earth  was the centre of the universe and  all objects, the Sun, the Moon, and  other Planets revolved around it.  This assumption was based on the  fact that the Earth was stationary  while the placement of the stars  and planets seemed to change  over time.     The Planet, Earth    The breakthrough to this false belief came when Nicholas   Copernicus, a Polish astronomer,  who put forth his theory of the Earth’s  revolution around the Sun.   It was hence proved that the Earth  revolves around the Sun and completes  one full revolution in 365 and one-  fourth days. This is the period of one  year according to the calendar.         Also, it was proved that the Earth rotates along its own axis which  makes a vertical angle of 23 and half degrees. One rotation gets  completed in 24 days and this makes one full day.     CELESTIAL EQUATOR    Orbit direction!    NORTH    CELESTIAL    Perpendicular    POLE    to orbit    Axial tilt   I    Rotation Axis    ECLIPTIC    SOUTH   CELESTIAL   POLE    The Earth Moving on its Own Axis    The question that arises is, if the Earth rotates and revolves at the  same time, why do’nt we feel any motion? It is because of the force  of gravity. All things on this Earth move along with it and hence, we  don’t feel it.   It is like an ant on a rotating football. The ant doesn’t feel any  movement because it moves with the ball. Similarly, all objects on  the Earth move along with it. Hence, we are unable to feel any kind  of motion of the Earth as it rotates or revolves.   The change of seasons is the biggest proof of the Earth’s motion. The  seasons change because of the Earth’s revolution around the Sun        and also because of its rotation along its own axis. Day and night are  also caused because of rotation as the part of the Earth that faces  the Sun, experiences day while the other experiences night.   If the Earth did not rotate, the part facing the Sun would always  get day, while the other would experience night all the time. The  Earth’s, axis makes a vertical angle of 23 and half degrees. As a  result of this, the North Pole and the South Pole faces the Sun for six  continuous months. This explains the six-month duration of days  and nights at the poles.    Tipped   Axis     Sunlight Hitting Different Parts of the Earth    The day and night are caused by the Earth’s rotation, while the  change of seasons occurs due to its revolution around the Sun.         We don’t feel the Earth spin because along with us,  the atmosphere, skyscrapers, and everything else  are spinning along at the same constant speed.   It’s the same sensation as when you’re riding in a  car or flying in a plane - as long as the ride is going  smoothly. A jumbo jet flies at about 500 miles per  hour - that’s about 800 kilometers an hour - about  half as fast as the Earth spins at its Equator. But  if you close your eyes, you don’t feel like you’re  moving at all. And when the flight attendant comes  by and pours coffee into your cup, the coffee doesn’t  fly to the back of the aeroplane. That’s because the  coffee, the cup and you are all moving at the same  speed as the plane.   Likewise, the Earth is moving at a fixed rate - and  we’re all moving along with it. Now imagine being  on the jumbo jet again - think about what happens  when the pilot suddenly speeds up or slows down  the plane. You sometimes sense this change as a  feeling of being pushed into your seat. In the same  way, if the Earth were suddenly to speed up or slow  down, you would definitely feel it.   But as long as the Earth spins steadily - and moves  at a constant rate in orbit around the Sun - you as  an Earthly passenger move right along with it.   If the Earth suddenly started to speed up, we’d fall  over backwards, and we’d have to lean into the  direction of the motion to stand.           HOW FAR IS A STAR?    The innumerable stars that brighten a night sky are made up of  hot gases. Even the Sun is a star. However, there are various other  stars that are brighter than the Sun but cannot be seen by us. This  is because of their distance from the Earth. Stars may look like tiny  dots in the sky but are actually really big, some even bigger than  planets. They appear small to us because they are very far away.  Have you ever thought exactly how far stars are from the Earth?   The unit of measuring distance of stars is light years. One light year  is referred to the distance travelled by light in one year, the velocity  of light being three hundred thousand kilometers per second. The  star nearest to the Earth is the Sun. It is followed by a star called the  Proxima Centauri, whose distance from the Earth is about 4.28 light  years. However, this star is only visible in the southern hemisphere.   The nearest star which is visible from the northern hemisphere is  Sirius, also called the Dog Star. From the Earth, it is around 8.8 light  years away. Apart from these, another important neighboring star is  the Alpha Centauri, which is 4.37 light years away from our planet.   The star farthest from us which is visible to our naked eye is more  than 8 million light years away from Earth. If a powerful telescope is  used, one can see stars that are a 1,000 times more distant.           It may sound shocking but it is true that there are some stars in this  universe that are so far away from us that their light takes more than  a 1,000 million years to reach us.   Stars contain the greatest secrets about the universe. Studying the  evolution of a star can help reveal many unknown facts about our  galaxy and planet. It is due to this reason that since times immemorial,  people have been curious about the tiny sparkles we enjoy gazing  at in the night.    3     A Boy Looking at the Stars with a Telescope    From way back in time, people have been inventing newer devices  to expose the secrets of stars. Over time, scientists have created a  variety of optical and radio telescopes for the study of stars. They  have been successful in gaining knowledge about these heavenly  bodies, but there is still a lot which is yet to be discovered.            Quicd &ids   Stars are cosmic energy engines that produce heat,  light, ultraviolet rays, x-rays, and other forms of  radiations. They are composed largely of gases and  plasma, a superheated state of matter composed of  subatomic particles.   Though the most familiar star, our own Sun, stands  alone, about three of every four stars exist as part of a  binary system containing two mutually orbiting stars.   No one knows how many stars exist, but the number  would be staggering. Our universe likely contains  more than 100 billion galaxies, and each of these  galaxies may have more than 100 billion stars.   Some stars have always stood out from the rest. Their  brightness is a factor of how much energy they put  out, which is called their luminosity, and also how  far away from the Earth they are.   Stars may occur in many sizes, which are classified  in a range from dwarfs to supergiants. Supergiants  may have radii a thousand times larger than that of  our own Sun.   I'- Hydrogen is the primary building block of stars. The  gas circles through space in cosmic dust clouds called  the Nebulae. In time, gravity causes these clouds  to condense and collapse in on themselves. As they  get smaller, the clouds spin faster because of the  conservation of angular momentum. Young stars are  called Protostars. As they develop, they accumulate  mass from the clouds around them and grow into what  are known as main sequence stars. The main sequence  stars like our own Sun exist in a state of nuclear fusion  during which they will emit energy for billions of years  by converting hydrogen to helium.           THE MASS OF THE EARTH    Whenever a body has to be measured, it is done through the use of  a weighing balance. The balance is in accordance with the object  to be weighed. Our planet, Earth is a giant object. Hence, to weigh  the Earth, thinking of a weighing scale is impossible.   An interesting story lies behind the weighing of the Earth.   Newton was a great scientist and made many advancements in the  field of science. He introduced theories and laws that are widely used  even today. Actually, scientifically, to weigh the Earth, Newton’s law  of gravitation is used.   This law states that there exists a force  of attraction between any two bodies  in the universe and this is dependent  on the masses of the two bodies as  well as on the distance between them.   Moreover, the force of attraction is  directly proportional to the product  of the masses of the two bodies and  inversely proportional to the square of  distances between them.         To determine the mass of the Earth, an  experiment is conducted. It is done with  the help of the above mentioned law.   In the first step of this experiment, a small  metallic ball is suspended with the help of  a thin piece of thread. Then, the accurate  position of the ball is determined. After  this, a huge lead ball that weighs a ton  is brought close to the ball. When this  is done, the small ball is attracted towards the big lead ball and  moves from its initial position. This change in position is due to the  gravitational force. In this case, it is less than one-tenth of an inch.   This displacement can be accurately measured. It is done very  accurately and carefully with the help of precision instruments.   Through this concept of measuring displacement, the mass of the  Earth has been determined. The approximate mass of the Earth is  calculated to be somewhere around 5980,000,000,000,000,000,000  tonnes!   Hence, it is only apt to say that to calculate the mass of the Earth is  a very tough task and can be done only with the help of Science.     The Earth is the biggest of all the terrestrial planets.  A terrestrial planet is a dense planet found in  the inner Solar System. The diameter of Earth is  7,926 miles. The circumference measured around  the equator is 24,901 miles. There are currently  almost 7 billion people living on the Earth. About  30% of the Earth’s surface is covered with land,  while about 70% is covered by oceans.     Sir Isaac Newton        % Our planet, the Earth is an oasis of life in an otherwise  desolate universe. The Earth’s temperature, weather,  atmosphere and many other factors are just right to  keep us alive.   ♦<- The Earth is about 4.5 billion years old.   4- The size of the Earth is approximately 7,926.41  miles (12,756.32 km) in equatorial diameter.

THE TWINKLING OF STARS    One of the first things that a toddler learns is the famous rhyme,  ‘Twinkle twinkle little star..      From the young ones to the elderly people, everybody enjoys  gazing at the night sky at one time or the other. Their mesmerising  sight has the power  to appeal to the  senses.    Stars radiate light  in all directions.  Though they   appear small, some  stars are even  bigger than the  Earth itself. Have  you ever wondered  why the stars in the  sky twinkle?   The atmosphere   blankets the Earth,  protecting it from    Mantle  continues cioum  to outer core    C yomin*mtal    Oceanic    Atmosphere    crust    cries r    Crust    Upper   mantle    Mantle    Outer   core    Outer core of  molten metal    Solid metal  inner core    The Sun is also a Star      harmful radiations that come from the outer space. Beyond it is  a huge vacuum. The atmosphere consists of various gases which  are always in motion. Due to their movements, the density of the  atmosphere is never constant. Moreover, the refractive index of air  varies from place to place.   The light of a star, after entering the Earth’s atmosphere, gets deviated  a number of times due to the changing densities and consequent  changes in the refractive index of the air.   Refraction refers to the degree of change or deviation in the path  of light when it enters from one medium to the other. And Iindeed,  it is due to refraction that the stars twinkle. Due to the changing  refractive index of the air, the light coming from the stars gets  refracted at different angles before reaching our eyes. This leads to  the fluctuation of light entering into our eyes.   Knowing this, one may wonder why other planets or the moon does  not twinkle. This is because while stars are smaller in size, planets  are bigger. Stars can be considered as point-like structures in the  night sky. However, planets are an extended source or a collection  of the point size sources of light. So much so, that they cancel out  the effect of twinkling.   Also, due to larger  angles, the deviation  of the path of light  from the moon and  planets does not get  detected by our eyes.  Thus, they don’t  appear to twinkle.     The Twinkling Stars at Night      Quictl ffhcts   % The stars do not twinkle. Their light gets distorted  by the churning gases in the Earth’s atmosphere.  We only notice the twinkling as stars are tiny  points of light and are thousands of light-years  away, whereas, planets don’t twinkle as they’re  close enough to appear as tiny discs.   Stars are generally huge balls of gases in outer  space. Made from hydrogen, helium and other  elements, stars produce light, heat and other forms  of energy.   Stars are in constant conflict with themselves. The  collective gravity of all the mass of a star is pulling  it inward. If there was nothing to stop it, the star  would just continue collapsing for millions of years  until it became its smallest possible size; maybe  as a neutron star.   The nuclear fusion at the core of a star generates  a tremendous amount of energy. The photons push  outward as they make their journey from inside  the star to reach the surface; a journey that can  take 100,000 years. When stars become more  luminous, they expand outward becoming red  giants. And when they run out of the light pressure,  they collapse down into white dwarfs.     1.68      Chapter -19    THE FORCE OF GRAVITY    The centre of gravity lies at the  centre of the Earth. Hence, if a  hole is drilled in the Earth, from  one side to the other and an  object is thrown inside from one  side, it will stop at the centre due  to gravity and not come out of the  other end.     It is a known fact that there exists an invisible force on our Earth  which pulls all objects towards the  centre of the Earth. It is because  of this force that everything that is  thrown up comes back, and this  force is called gravity.    Also, the weight of a body will  be more if it is close to the centre   of tfl0 Earth Similstrly th0 body Apple Falling due to Gravitational Force   would weigh less if it is away from it. This is the reason why things  weigh more at the Poles than at the Equator, because the Poles are  closer to the centre of the Earth.         Latitude    Longituda    Not only the Earth,  but all the planets  have this force of  gravity. In fact, all  objects of the universe Equ “ or  attract each other. It is  this force which keeps  all the objects in their  place. This force is  also responsible for  the revolution of the Moon around the Earth and the Earth around  the Sun.   It is obvious that the Moon also attracts the Earth. This is the reason  behind the tides in the seas.   Till the 16th century, it was believed that in vacuum, if two bodies  were dropped from the same height simultaneously, the heavier  body would hit the ground first. However, this assumption was  broken by Galileo Galilei. He proved that irrespective of their  masses, all objects dropped from the same point at the same time  would hit the ground together in a vacuum.   He did so by throwing two balls of different masses from the Leaning  Tower of Pisa in front of a thousand people.   Subsequently, Newton declared the law of gravity which states that,  the force of attraction between two bodies is directly proportional to  the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square  of the distance between them. Hence, if the mass of one of the  two bodies is doubled, the force of attraction between them also  doubles.   However, if the distance between the two objects is doubled, the  force of attraction between them will reduce by one- fourth of the  initial value.                          • On Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8m/  sec 2   The Universal Gravity Constant is 6.7E-11.   • Sir Isaac Newton came up with the idea of gravity  when he saw an apple fall from a tree.   The force of gravity decreases as you get farther  away from the Earth.   The force of gravity increases with an object of  mass.   Gravity is caused as a result of space and time  woven together.   In a circular orbit, the centrifugal force is equal to  the gravitational force.   The force of gravity on the Moon is smaller than  the force of gravity on the Earth.   The gravitational force is smaller than the electric  force when compared with the same mass.         Chapter - 20    ASTRONAUTS    Astronauts, also called cosmonauts,  are highly trained professionals who  travel to space. Explorers of the  universe, these astronauts get trained  by a human spaceflight program to  become members of a spacecraft.   The first person to ever go into  space was Yuri Gagarin in 1961.   He orbited around the Earth for 108  minutes. The first woman in space was Valentina Tereshkova,   who orbited the Earth for almost 3 days. The  youngest space traveller was Gherman Titov,  who was 25 when he flew on a spacecraft. He  was also the first to suffer ‘space sickness.’ On  the other hand, the oldest astronaut was John  Glenn, who flew at the age of 77.   For the execution of a project, different astronauts have different  designations and duties.      An Astronauts in Space    #' A Pilot Astronaut has the onboard responsibility of the crew,  vehicle, success of the mission, and safety of the flight.       # A Mission Specialist Astronaut coordinates all the operations  of the shuttle. They are expected to have a detailed knowledge  of the shuttle and objectives of the mission as they perform  extravehicular activities and assist in experiment operations.   # A Payload Specialist is an additional member to the crew who  may be needed for certain specific  the need of the operation.   While on a project, astronauts consume  specially processed food which is easy  to store and eat in the low-gravity  environment. It is usually in the form of  toothpaste tubes and contains all the vital  nutrients that help to maintain the health  of the astronauts.   The National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA) first selected astronauts for training in 1959.  Although the requirements to become an astronaut today are very  high, the first selected John Glenn and Scott Carpenter, of the  Mercury Seven Group, did not have a college degree at the time  of selection.   In today’s times, the NASA has laid down  an extremely challenging requirement list for  aspiring astronauts. The basic requirements  for an astronaut include a bachelor’s degree in  engineering, biological science, physical science  or mathematics, and at least 1,000 hours of pilot-  in-command experience in a jet aircraft. Also, they  are required to pass a physical test that includes  distant visual acuity: 20/100, blood pressure:  140/90 measured in a sitting position and height  between 62 and 75 inches.      An Astronaut in Space Suit    tasks, depending oupon     Food for Astronauts         After selection, the chosen astronauts go through an extensive training  of 20 months to become competent of experiencing the conditions  of space. This includes training for Extra-vehicular Activities (EVA)  in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, periods of weightlessness in  the KC-135, also called the ‘vomit comet’, and flight experience of  the T-38 jet aircraft.     %< In space, it is not possible to breathe air normally, so an  astronaut’s spacesuit is outfitted with oxygen so that he/  she can breathe when working outside of the spacecraft.   %<- Astronauts can urinate while wearing their spacesuits  outside the spacecraft. He or she usually wears a  maximum absorbency garment (MAG), which can  hold up to two litres of fluid.   %< Astronauts sleep in bunk beds or in sleeping bags.  However, these bunk beds must be fitted with buckles  so that the astronauts can buckle up. Otherwise, they  might float around the spacecraft while sleeping.   They can choose from 70 different types of food.  However, the food will either be already prepackaged for  them or need just a very small amount of preparation.  Sometimes, when the astronauts are eating, the food  will float around, as there is no gravity.   %< While not actively working, astronauts can read books,  watch movies, or talk to family and friends on Earth.  They can even use an exercise bike, (they have to do a  lot of exercise to stay healthy.)   The first living animal in orbit was a dog from Russia  called Laika. It travelled into space on Sputnik 2 in  1957.          THE WORLD                                        Chapter -1      THE STONE AGE    The Stone Age is that era in the history of  mankind which is considered the landmark  when human beings learnt to make use  of stone tools. This age began more  than three million years ago and lasted till  around 5,000 years back. This age was  followed by the Bronze Age. After this  came the Metal Age, the time when man  started using metals.   The Stone Age has broadly been classified into three periods:   #' The Paleolithic or the Old Stone Age   The Mesolithic or the Middle Stone Age   # The Neolithic or the New Stone Age   The Old or the Paleolithic Stone Age is  marked with the appearance of the first  ‘hominids’ or man-like forms, for example,  the Australopithecines. Men of this age were  all hunters. They designed crude tools, made  out of flaking stones. These tools date back  to around 25,00,000 years ago. It is believed                       that apart from stones, woods  and bones were also made  use of to fabricate tools.   The Pleistoce Epoch began  25,00,000 years back and  lasted till 10,000 years back.   It was during the latter part of  this age that ‘hominids’ learnt   the art of making paintings Early Man Making Clay Pots   on caves and also the art of sculpture.    The Mesolithic or the Middle Stone Age began around 8000 B.C.,  when certain advancement started in north-western Europe. This  age saw betterment in the design of the stone tools. Hunters started  using tiny flint flakes in making harpoons and arrows. This age  ended in 2700 B.C.    The Neolithic or the New Stone Age saw further advancement  as it marked the beginning of farming and the manufacture of  pottery in Europe. This age began around 9,000 years ago in the  Middle East. People of this time learnt to grind and polish stones  and manufactured smooth axe heads. Moreover, agriculture and  domestication of animals were among the most vital characteristics  of the Neolithic Age.   It was also during this time that the practice of mining had begun.  Agriculture had started and people had also begun forming villages.  Soon after this period, people learnt making use of metals. This  marked the end of the Stone Age and the beginning of the Metal  Age.   When America was discovered by the Europeans, most of the  Native Americans were living in the Neolithic Stone Age. In some  parts of the world, people such as the Australian aborigines and the  tribes in New Guinea continued to live in the Stone Age.                  QuicH rJacU   % There are no written records from the Stone Age.  What we know about the Stone Age humans  comes from things they made, like weapons, tools,  shelters and other objects discovered mostly in  archaeological digs. Engraving designs on stones  and bones, carved figures and drawings on the  walls of caves also give us information and help  us trace the slow development of Human Beings  or Homo sapiens throughout the period.   The Stone Age is divided into Paleolithic, Mesolithic  and Neolithic periods, marking the progressive  levels of sophistication found in artifacts and  cultural activities.   The Paleolithic Age stretches from about 2-2.5  million years BCE to 10,000 years BCE, which is  about 95 percent of the time humans and their  direct ancestors have been residing on this planet.   ♦<- Food was obtained mostly by hunting, fishing and  collecting wild plants, nuts and fruits.     T            Chapter - 2    THE INTERNATIONAL  DATE LINE <IDL)    It is a known fact that, with  15 degrees longitude for each  hour, the Earth is divided into  24 one-hour zones. These 24  zones complete one full day  on our planet. Moreover, since  the Earth rotates eastward,  the progression of time on the  clock is westward around the  world.     Thus, the occurrence of 12  o’clock noon in London  happens five hours before   it does in Washington D.C . ? A Globe Showing Latitudes and Longitudes   which is 75 degrees west of London   and eight hours earlier at San Francisco, which is 120 degrees west  of London. Therefore, at the time it is noon in London, it is midnight  at the International Date Line or the IDL.             Latitude    Equator    To define it in  simple terms, the  International Date  Line can be referred  to as an imaginary  line, extending from  the North Pole to the  South Pole. On its  way, it cuts through  the Pacific Ocean.   This line is extremely  important as it is the entire time system that the world works on.  Each day on the Earth begins and ends at the International Date  Line. At whichever point it crosses over land or divides nations, it  gets diverted to pass over the Pacific Ocean.     90 90   South   <-)    The Earth is divided into 360° Longitudes    This line is responsible for the deviation of east of the 180 degree  Longitude to pass through the Bering Strait and include the Eastern  Siberia and then towards west to include the Aleutian Islands with  Alaska. Towards the south of the Equator, the line again bulges  eastward to let various island groups to experience the same day as  New Zealand.    What needs to be understood is that the Earth is divided into 360  longitudes vertically, 180 on both eastern and western sides. The  zero degree longitude passes through Greenwich and the 180  degrees longitude is called the International Date Line. On either  sides of this line, the time is the same, but with a difference of 24  hours. It is because of this that a person who is travelling in the  westward direction across the line has to adjust his calendar back  by one day.   In other words, it implies that if a person crosses the International  Date Line while going eastward, he gains a day, while somebody  travelling in the opposite direction loses a day.                               The International Date Line (IDL) is an imaginary  line that shows where the beginning of one day  and the end of another come together. The Line  is drawn vertically on maps and runs between the  eastern tip of Russia and the western tip of Alaska,  then down to the west of Hawaii, and then down to  the east of New Zealand, and so on. It has several  zigzags in it, too. It goes through no land except  Antarctica.   Points near the Line are almost 24 hours apart.  When it is Tuesday in New Zealand, it is Monday in  Hawaii. This is because the globe is divided into  Time Zones that total to 24 hours. So, if you board  a plane in Juneau, Alaska, on Monday and fly west  to Tokyo, Japan, you will arrive on Tuesday. This is  because the Earth is round.   Many years went by before someone proposed a  Date Line, opposite the Prime Meridian. It began  to be drawn on maps as early as the 17th Century  and was not popularly adopted until much later.   Even today, no law proclaims that an International  Date Line exists. Still, most of the globes and maps  of the world include it.            THE NAME, 'AMERICA'    Today, the United States of America(USA) is the big brother of  the world. Regarded as a superpower, America is one of the most  powerful countries in the world. It has developed mainly in the past  100 years.

In the year 1492, the  renowned Italian traveller, Christopher  Columbus went on a sea voyage to  search for India. On the morning of  October 12, 1492, he arrived on an  island which he named, ‘San Salvador’  after the King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain. Thinking it to  be India, he called its inhabitants, Indians. This island is actually a  part of America. It is presently known as the Watling Island.   Even though politically these people  are Native Americans today, their  descendants are often referred to as  Red Indians. In his search for Japan,  Christopher Columbus discovered Cuba  and Hispaniola. On not being able to  locate India, disappointed Columbus  returned to Spain in the March of 1493.   Columbus set out on a second journey on September 24, 1493.  This time he succeeded in discovering many Virgin Islands, such  as Jamaica and Puerto Rico. However, his efforts to locate India  once again went in vain.   During his third voyage in 1498, Columbus located Trinidad and  touched upon South America. Around this time, a  Florentine sailor called Amerigo Vespucci declared  that he was the one to discover the mainland of  South America on June 16,1497.   In the year 1499, Amerigo Vespucci, along with  Alonso de Ojeda sailed to Orinoco Straits and  located Venezuela. Later, in the year, 1501-1502,   Vespucci directed a voyage himself and discovered  Brazil under the Portuguese banner.          Soon, it became clear to Vespucci that what Christopher Columbus  had discovered as India, was not a part of Asia but a different  continent altogether. Vespucci started writing about this and these  were widely spread during the beginning of 1500. He went on to  become the first European to discover South America.   A German geographer named Waldsee Miller, to honour Amerigo  Vespucci, named the territory of Brazil as South America. Today,  the North America and South America are collectively referred  to as the Americas.     The United States of America (USA) is one of  the largest countries in the world based on both  population and land area. It has a relatively short  history compared to other world nations, has one  of the world’s largest economies, and has one of  the world’s most diverse populations. As such, the  United States is highly influential internationally.   The United States is divided into 50 states.  However, each state varies in size considerably.  The smallest state is the Rhode Island with an  area of just 1,545 square miles (4,002 sq km). By  contrast, the largest state by area is Alaska with  663,268 square miles (1,717,854 sq km).   Alaska has the longest coastline in the United  States at about 6,640 miles (10,686 km).   The Bristlecone pine trees, believed to be some of  the world’s oldest living things, are found in the  western United States in California, Utah, Nevada,  Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona. The oldest of  these trees is in California and the oldest living  tree itself is found in Sweden.         Chapter - 4    HOW WAS THE UK FORMED?    The United Kingdom comnprisessists of four main places which   are England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. It was   formed in the year, 1801 when the ‘Act of Union’ enveloped Ireland  under the same parliament as Scotland, Wales, and England.    The Act of Union,  1801 described  two complementary  Acts, namely, the  ‘Union with Ireland  Act 1800’, an Act  of the Parliament  of Great Britain,  and the Act of  Union (Ireland)  1800’, an Act of  the Parliament of  Ireland. Passed on  July 2, 1800 and  August 1, 1800   respectively, the  twin acts united     1     I    .86                the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland to create  the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The union came  into effect on January 1, 1801. Both acts together formed the United  Kingdom, as we know it today.   In 1921, 26 Irish countries left the Union to form the Irish Free  State, also known as the Republic of Ireland.   Five years later, in the year 1926, the ‘Royal  Parliamentary Titles Act’ renamed the union.   It was then called the United Kingdom of  Great Britain and Northern Ireland.   The system of government followed here is  that of a constitutional monarchy and the  monarchy is hereditary.   Wales, being subdued by King Edward I  in 1282, was the first to unite with England.   Ever since Edward gave his title to his son in  1301, the heir to the English throne is called The Prince of Wales.  However, it was only in 1536, when Henry VIII, the Tudor monarch  of Welsh descent passed an Act of Union that the principle was  peacefully incorporated into the kingdom.   Great Britain was introduced as the name when King James VI of  Scottish origin united and succeeded the English throne as Janies I  in 1603 and the two crowns. However, he could not unite the nations.   It was in the year, 1707 that another Act  of Union brought Scotland and England  under one government. The present  flag of the United Kingdom consists  of the flags of England (white with an  upright red cross), the red vertical cross  of Ireland, and the flag of Scotland (blue  with a diagonal white cross).                  The Royal Titles Act that was passed on May 29, 1953, issued the  Queen the title of ‘Elizabeth,, the second’, by the Grace of God,  of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and  ofin her other realms and territories, the Queen, the Head of the  Commonwealth, the Defender of the fFaith’.    Qiiicti ffhcls   The United Kingdom or UK is a developed country  and has the world’s seventh-largest economy  by nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and  the eighth-largest economy by purchasing power  parity. It was the world’s first industrialised  country and the world’s foremost power during  the 19th and early 20th centuries.   f- UK is presently recognised as a nuclear weapons’  state and its military expenditure ranks fourth in  the world.   The United Kingdom has been a permanent  member of the United Nations Security Council  since its first session in 1946. It has been a member  of the European Union and its predecessor, the  European Economic Community since 1973.  It is also a member of the Commonwealth of  Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7, the G8,  the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the  World Trade Organisation (WTO).             Chapter - 5    THE CENSUS    1.89    The government takes a census every ten years to keep account of  the population of a region. You may have noticed people coming to  your house for a survey, asking about the number of family members,  their age, gender, etc. This data is collected and organised. This  process is called census.                  It is known that around 4000 B.C., the population of the world  was around 85 million. This proves that a census was taken at that  time as well. The story behind the origin of census is unknown.  However, another important aspect of the census is why it is taken.  The reasons behind conducting census have changed with changing  scenarios of the world.   At the times of monarchies, the kings ordered for a census to assess  the number of people available for wars. Another prime reason for  conducting the census was for the collection of revenue. In earlier  times, these were the two main reasons. However, over time, man  has discovered many more uses of this process.   In today’s times, one of the most important advantages of conducting  a census is that it presents a clear picture of the demographics of the  region it is conducted in. Aspects, such as health, education, income  group, etc., can help the government in devising appropriate social  schemes for the benefits of the society.   Apart from this, a census also helps in judging the increase or  decrease in the population of the region. Moreover, the birth rate  can be determined and a ratio between rural and urban population  can be calculated.   Due to these reasons, conducting a census becomes important for  a country as it helps the government of a nation to act according to  the need of the hour. A population count helps a nation determine  if its provisions are adequate enough. Having an approximate idea  of birth rate can help a nation prepare better for its future citizens.  Lastly, the study of these demographics helps in elections as it is  the population that decideds the number of voters in a particular  constituency.   Apart from these direct implications, a census is very useful for the  betterment of law and order and other socio-economic situations.   India conducted its first census in the year 1872. Since then, it is done      every ten years. The latest census of 2012 shows the population of  India to be around 1.22 billion.     I'- The Census Act was passed in 1948 and was placed  on the Statute Book. In 1949, the Government of  India decided to initiate steps for the improvement  of Registration of Vital Statistics and further decided  to establish a single organisation at the Centre in  the Ministry of Home Affairs under the Registrar  General and ex-officio Census Commissioner for  India to deal with Vital Statistics and Census.   4- HU 1951, the Census Organisation in India was  functioning like the phoenix, that is the Organisation  came into being just on the eve of the census and  wound up as soon as census operations were over  within two or three years of its creation. With the  establishing of a permanent nucleus at the centre,  it has been possible to have continuing Census  Organisation during the inter-censal period.  Concentrated steps were taken to improve registration  of Births and Deaths in the country to yield reliable  vital rates which are so essential for the present day  planning.   %- The first census after Independence was taken in 1951.  This report attempted to interpret the past changes  in the size and structure of India’s population and to  point out their implications for the level of living of the  population. The report also made a plea for a reduction  in the birth rate of the country. The 1951 census also  attempted for the first time in the history of Indian  census to make an assessment of the accuracy of the  census count by a recheck in the field.    I               THE FORMATION OF  GRAND CANYON    Located in Arizona, U.S.A., the Grand Canyon is a natural wonder  of the world. It is renowned for its spectacular view, the colourful  rocks, and the majestic ambience. While travelling the Grand  Canyon, one may imagine being lost in a city of rocks, with towers  temples and castles in vibrant colours.   However, this panorama has a great history behind it. Have you  ever wondered how The Grand Canyon was built? Well, here’s your    answer.          The formation of the Grand Canyon is a result of the continuous  erosion of the Colorado River Valley. The immense force of the  Colorado River cut out a great gorge thousands of years ago. Even  now, each year the mighty force of the rushing water of this river  continues to cut the bottom of this gorge deeper and deeper. This  has made this the deepest gorge in the world.   Stretched up to 347.2 kilometers in length, the Grand Canyon is  approximately 20 kilometers wide and up to 2 kilometers deep at  certain places.   Since long ago, the Colorado River has been slowly cutting through  the plateaus of northern Arizona, unleashing the strata of the Earth  that is millions of years old. A subject of prime interest for geologists,  these strata offer knowledge about the Earth’s history.   An ancient Precambrian rock can be found at the bottom of the  Canyon, where the Colorado River flows. It contains the fossils of  primitive algae. In the higher strata, fossils of dinosaurs, elephants,  trees, and other organisms can also be found. The top of the  Canyon represents the most recent rocks. The fossils contained in  the Canyon are extremely important as they provide useful insights  into the evolutionary processes of the Earth’s inhabitants.   The Grand Canyon is a top favourite for tourists. This spectacular  site attracts more than two million tourists, each year. The Canyon  offers its tourists a breathtaking view and a lot of mood swings that  change just as the colour of the rocks.   In the year, 1919, the United States Government built the Grand  Canyon National Park to promote and preserve the richness of  plant and animal life that has become an integral part of this unique  environment.    Quicii ffacfo    The geology of the Grand Canyon area exposes one  of the most complete and studied sequences of rock  on the Earth. The nearly 40 major sedimentary rock  layers exposed in the Grand Canyon and in the Grand  Canyon National Park area range in age from about  200 million to nearly 2 billion years old. Most were  deposited in warm, shallow seas and sea shores in  western North America. Both marine and terrestrial  sediments are represented, including fossilised sand  dunes from an extinct desert. There are at least 14  known unconformities in the geological record found  in the Grand Canyon area.   Wetter climates brought upon by ice ages starting  2 million years ago greatly increased the excavation  of the Grand Canyon, which was nearly as deep as  it is now by 1.2 million years ago. Volcanic activity  deposited lava over the area 1.8 million to 500,000  years ago. At least 13 lava dams blocked the Colorado  River, forming lakes that were up to 2,000 feet (610  m) deep. The end of the last ice age and subsequent  human activity has greatly reduced the ability of the  Colorado River to excavate the canyon.   However, in December 2012, a study published  in the journal. Science claimed that new tests  suggested that the Grand Canyon could be as old  as 70 million years.           r    Chapter - 7    THE STORY BEHIND  MONA LISA    The painting of Mona Lisa is one of the  most renowned pieces of art mankind has  ever witnessed. Painted by Leonardo da  Vinci, it is the portrait of a woman with  a mysterious smile. The painting has left  people wondering what she is smiling at.  Today, the Mona Lisa painting hangs in Paris  at the Louvre Museum, which preserves the  world’s finest art works and antiques.      This painting was made by Leonardo da  Vinci between 1503 and 1506. The lady   in the painting, Mona  Lisa, was the wife of a Florentine gentleman,  Francesco del Gioconda. She was 24 at the  time, the 51-year-old Leonardo started working  on this painting. Mona Lisa used to come to his  studio every day in the late afternoon, at the  time the light was soft.             This painting was worked on for four years, during which Leonardo  da Vinci became fascinated with both his model and the portrait.  That is why this portrait has retained an exclusive ambience around  itself.   Mona Lisa’s face, charismatic and graceful, has amazed billions of  people over the years. It seems like the painting has life in it. The  background is mysteriously portrayed as a misty scenery.   It is known that Leonardo da Vinci was so  obsessed with the painting himself that he never  gave it to Francesco. He always made an excuse  and carried it with him wherever he went. It is  also believed that while he was working on the  painting, he used jesters, musicians, etc. to keep  his model in a merry mood.   When Leonardo came to France in 1516, King  Francis gave him a beautiful mansion in the  Loire valley. He offered him 4,000 gold crowns  for the painting but could not acquire it till Leonardo’s death in 1519.  Since then, the painting has been a possession of the emperors of  France.   It is remarkable that in the past 450  years, the painting has gone out of  France only twice. In 1911, the painting  was stolen, but found two years later in  Italy. The second time, the painting went  missing for 26 days, while it was taken  during an amazingly well-guarded and  immensely insured visit to the United  States of America as a guest of the then  President, John F. Kennedy.     scenery.         • Leonardo used a pyramid design to place the woman  simply and calmly in the space of the painting. Her  folded hands form the front corner of the pyramid.  Her breast, neck and face glow in the same light  that models her hands. The light gives the variety of  living surfaces an underlying geometry of spheres  and circles. Leonardo referred to a seemingly  simple formula for the seated female figure: the  images of seated Madonna, which were widespread  at the time. He effectively modified this formula in  order to create the visual impression of distance  between the sitter and the observer. The armrest of  the chair functions as a dividing element between  Mona Lisa and the viewer.   I'- The woman sits markedly upright with her arms  folded, which is also a sign of her reserved posture.  Only her gaze is fixed on the observer and seems  to welcome him to this silent communication.  Since the brightly lit face is practically framed  with various much darker elements (hair, veil,  shadows), the observer’s attraction to it is brought  to even greater extent. The woman appears alive to  an unusual measure, which Leonardo achieved by  his new method by not drawing the outlines.   I'- Some art historians of the Eastern art, such as  Yukio Yashiro , also argue that the landscape in the  background of the picture was influenced by the  Chinese paintings.     Chapter - 8    WHAT IS RED CROSS?    An international humanitarian *  organisation, called the Red  Cross Foundation is devoted  to alleviate all kinds of human  suffering. The Red Cross has  offices in almost all countries  of the world that help people  regardless of their sex, race,  colour, etc. at times of both peace and war.     The Red Cross Flag     In times of peace, its goals are to provide first aid, provide safe  drinking water, prevent accidents, train nurses, set up hospitals,  establishing blood banks, etc. On the other hand, at times of war, its   main objective is to provide healthcare to  wounded soldiers and victims.    The origin of this organisation is very  engaging. The founder of Red Cross,  Henri Dunant, a Swiss banker had  gone to the city of Lombardy in Italy  for business in 1859. The city at that time  was the focus of the ‘Battle of Solferino’,  between Australia and France.    Henri Dunant        Dunant witnessed thousands of wounded people, desperate for  help, lying all around the roads. He was overwhelmed by the sight  and regardless of his work, started setting up local healthcare centres  in association with the villagers. He saved many lives through his  actions.   Three years after the war, Dunant wrote a book called, ‘A Memory of  Solferino’, appealing to the people of the world to form relief societies  for people affected by war. His idea gained worldwide recognition  and in the International Conference of 1864 held in Geneva, 16  countries agreed to set up the Red Cross Societies.   Thus, the Red Cross came into existence. It came to be known as the  organisation whose motive is to relieve people from their sufferings  caused by any kind of calamity.   The Red Cross has three organs. First is the International Committee  which consists of 25 citizens of Switzerland. Its main office is in  Geneva. The second is the League of the Red Cross Foundation and  the third is the National Red Cross Society.   At times of war, the International Committee looks after the prisoners  of war and arranges for their proper healthcare. It also helps them  connect to their relatives.   It also serves the people affected by natural disasters, such as,  cyclones, tsunamis, etc. The Red Cross Organisation, in another  word, is a friend to humanity.      • The International Red Cross and Red Crescent  Movement, born of a desire to bring assistance  without discrimination to the wounded on the  battlefield endeavours, in its international and  national capacity, to prevent and alleviate human  suffering wherever it may be found. Its purpose is to  protect life and health and to ensure respect for the  human beings. It promotes mutual understanding,  friendship, cooperation and lasting peace among  all the people.   It makes no discrimination as to nationality, race,  religious beliefs, class or political opinions. It  endeavours to relieve the suffering of individuals,  being guided solely by their needs, and to give priority  to the most urgent cases of distress.   It is a voluntary relief movement not prompted in  any manner by desire for gain.   There can be only one the Red Cross or one Red  Crescent Society in any one country. It must be  open to all. It must carry on its humanitarian work  throughout its territory.   The International Red Cross and the Red Crescent  Movement, in which all Societies have equal  status and share equal responsibilities and duties  in helping each other, is worldwide.        Chapter - 9      THE SEVEN WONDERS OF  THE ANCIENT WORLD   The world’s most exquisite and wonderful architectural creations  are referred to as the Wonders of the World. These wonders can  be broadly classified into two categories - the seven wonders of the  ancient world and the seven wonders of the modern world.   The wonders of the ancient world were regarded as magnificent  creations of early civilisations by the Romans and the Greeks. The  ancient seven wonders of the world consist of the following:   # The Pyramids of Egypt   # The Hanging Gardens of Babylon  & The Tomb of Mausolus   #' The Temple of Artemis (Diana)   #' The Colossus of Rhodes of Helios   # The Statue of Zeus   #' The Light House of Pharos near Alexandria   The Pyramids of Egypt: The Great Pyramid of Giza (also known  as the Pyramid of Khufu or the Pyramid of Cheops) is the oldest and          largest of the three pyramids in  the Giza Necropolis bordering  what is now El Giza, Egypt. It is  the oldest of the Seven Wonders  of the Ancient World, and the  only one to remain largely intact.   Egyptologists believe that the  pyramid was built as a tomb for the  fourth dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh  Khufu (Cheops in Greek) over a 10 to 20-year period concluding  around 2560 BCE. Initially at, 146.5 metres (481 feet), the Great  Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for over  3,800 years. Originally, the Great Pyramid was covered by casing  stones that formed a smooth outer surface; what is seen today is  the underlying core structure. Some of the casing stones that once  covered the structure can still be seen around the base. There have  been varying scientific and alternative theories about the Great  Pyramid’s construction techniques. Most accepted construction  hypotheses are based on the idea that it was built by moving huge  stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place.   There are three known chambers inside the Great Pyramid. The  lowest chamber is cut into the bedrock upon which the pyramid was  built and was unfinished. The so-called Queen’s Chamber and the  King’s Chamber are higher up within the pyramid structure. The  The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only pyramid in Egypt known  to contain both ascending and descending passages. The main  part of the Giza complex is a setting of buildings that included two  mortuary temples in the honour of Khufu (one close to the pyramid  and one near the Nile), three smaller pyramids for Khufu’s wives, an  even smaller ‘satellite’ pyramid, a raised causeway connecting the  two temples, and small mastaba tombs surrounding the pyramid for  the nobles.                The Hanging Gardens of  Babylon: These were one of the  Seven Wonders of the Ancient  World, and the only one of the  wonders that may have been  purely legendary. They were  purposely built in the ancient city-  state of Babylon, near present-  day A1 Hillah, Babil province, in  Iraq. The Hanging Gardens were  not the only World Wonder in Babylon; the city walls and obelisk  attributed to Queen Semiramis were also featured in the ancient list  of Wonders. The gardens were attributed to the Neo-Babylonian  king Nebuchadnezzar II, who ruled between 605 and 562 BC. He is  reported to have constructed the gardens to please his homesick wife  Amytis of Media, who longed for the plants of her homeland. The  gardens were said to have been destroyed by several earthquakes  after the 2nd century BC. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon are  documented by ancient Greek and Roman writers, including  Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, and Quintus Curtius Rufus. However, no  cuneiform texts describing the Hanging Gardens are extant, and no   definitive archaeological  evidence concerning their  whereabouts have been  found.   The Tomb of Mausolus:   One of the Seven Wonders  of the Ancient World,  the mausoleum was the  tomb of Mausolus, from  where the name came,  and it was the most  enduring achievement of his wife and sister Artemisia, the Younger,              who, after Mausolu’s death in 352 BC, had it built in his honour.  Mausolu’s tomb became one of the most famous architectural  showpieces of antiquity; it was named one of the Seven Wonders  of the World by the travel writers of the Hellenistic era. It consisted  of a solid rectangular base topped by 36 Ionic columns. These were  surmounted by a pyramid and crowned with a massive statue of  Mausolus and Artemisia riding a chariot, reaching a total height of  60 metres. The base was adorned with a frieze executed by four  of the leading sculptors of ancient Greece, one per side; classical  writers were most impressed by these sculptures.   For at least the last 20 years, a Danish team of archaeologists and  conservators, led by Prof. Kristian Jeppesen of the Aarhus University  in Denmark, has been excavating and preserving the little remains  of the site, consisting on the funerary underground chamber and  architectural remains, many of them were found in the vicinity and  the castle. The Mausoleum Museum was opened in 1988, thanks  to the joint auspices of the Turkish and Danish governments, now  under the management of the Bodrum Museum of Underwater  Archaeology.   The Temple of Artemis:   Also known less precisely as  the Temple of Diana, was a  Greek temple dedicated to a  goddess, Greeks identified  as Artemis and was one of  the Seven Wonders of the  Ancient World. It was located  in Ephesus (near the modern  town of Selguk in present-day  Turkey), and was completely rebuilt three times before its eventual  destruction in 401. Only foundations and sculptural fragments of  the latest of the temples at the site remain.                   The Colossus of Rhodes: This  was a statue of the Greek Titan  Helios, erected in the city of Rhodes  on the Greek island of Rhodes  by Chares of Lindos between  292 and 280 BC. It is considered  one of the Seven Wonders of the  Ancient World. It was constructed  to celebrate Rhodes’ victory over  the ruler of Cyprus, Antigonus  I Monophthalmus, whose son unsuccessfully besieged Rhodes in  305 BC. Before its destruction in the earthquake of 226 BC, the  Colossus of Rhodes stood over 30 metres (107 ft) high, making it  one of the tallest statues of the ancient world.   The Statue of Zeus: This statue was located  on the west coast of Greece at Olympia. In  the antiquity, this city was a place of cult  which contained numerous treasures of  the Greek art: temples, monuments, altars,  theaters, statues and marble or bronze votive  offerings. It was realised with golden and  ivory, measured 12 m (39 feet) height and  was placed on a base of 2 m (7 feet). The  base of the statue was 6 m (21 feet) wide and  1 m height. The statue’s perimeter was 13 m  (43 feet). This work touched almost the ceiling of the temple. On the  other hand, the throne was decorated with precious stones, ivory,  ebony and gold.   Zeus, in the sitting position, holds, in its right hand, the goddess of  Victory, Nike, and, in the left hand, a scepter surmounted by an  eagle. The throne was decorated with relief sculptured mythological  scenes, notably evoking the murder of the sons of Niobe, the Queen  of Thebes.   I                                             The Light House of  Pharos near Alexandria:   The Lighthouse was built  on the Island of Pharos in  the harbour of Alexandria,   Egypt. It was built around  290 BCE. It was a working  lighthouse that helped ships  find their way safely into the  harbour. It was also a tourist  attraction. Visitors could buy  food at the observation platform on the first level. Anyone who  wished to could climb nearly to the top. There were not many places  in the ancient world that visitors could climb a man-made structure,  300 feet up, to view the sea.   The Lighthouse stood for over 1500 years. Scientists believe an  earthquake topped the Lighthouse during the 1300’s. Divers today  search for remains at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. It was  situated in Egypt, near Alexandria. Made out of white marble, it was  constructed in 279 B.C. and was 122 metres high. It remained till  796 A.D. of these, only The Pyramids of Egypt are intact today.                    Quid £fa dd   • The construction of these wonders is an interesting  story. The surviving Pyramids of Egypt were built  around 5,000 years back. They were the tombs of  the ancient Pharos or Kings. The biggest Pyramid  is located near Cairo, in a town called Giza. This  was the tomb of Pharaoh Cheops and his queen.   Spread across an area of 5 hectares, its base forms  a square and is approximately 147 meters high.  The construction of thise tomb of Pharaoh Cheops  took over one lakh labourers and about 20 years.   4- The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were built in the  9th century B.C. by King Nebuchadnezzar for his  wife Amytis. Built with a series of terraces, one  on top of the other, they were 7.6 metre thick and  trees grew on each terrace. Irrigation in these high  gardens was done through pumping water from  river Euphrates. After the Persians took control of  the place, people left as it was in ruins.   4- The third wonder. The Tomb of Mausolus was built  by the ruler of Halicarnassus, King Marsolus. Though  he died before the tomb was completed, his wife  Artemesia looked into its construction. It was 42.6  meters high with a statue of the king and queen riding  a horse chariot. It eventually collapsed but its remains  are preserved in the British Museum, London.   4- The Temple of Artemis (Diana) of Ephesus with  its roof rested on two rows of approximately 200  metres high, was constructed in the honour of the  Goddess in 550 B.C. A mad man burnt it down in  365 B.C. Alexander the Great rebuilt it in 250 B.C.     I
